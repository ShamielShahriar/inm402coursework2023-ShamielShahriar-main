_A couple of sentences on why you need datavis to answer your research questions._

By using Data Visualisation to understand the housing market I will be able to present the information in a clear way which will help people comprehend the changes that have occured over the years and what things to lookout for when renting or buying a new house in England and Wales. Additionally, showing the data like this will aid buyers to see trends and regional comparisons to further aid in their decision making.
