- What do the most watched/scored episodes have in common in order to do so well?

_A couple of sentences on why you need datavis to answer your research questions._

Long Running Series such as One Piece are few and far between as most series tend to fail within their first season or overall Arc, so understanding what made this particular series so popular in the first place can help future series do just as well.

There have been other similar series such as Naruto and Bleach that ran concurrently with One Piece but for some reason, they never seemed to compare quite as much or do as well as One Piece did, specially at its peak and even now with new emerging series very rarely do they seem to keep up with it. Through the use of data visualisation, we are able to understand more about this series and get an accurate visual representation on how this series has done throughout the years. This can help us identify patters and issues that this series mightâ€™ve had which we could then apply to others to either benefit or prevent similar mistakes from occurring.
